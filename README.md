# Caesar Cipher Python Project

This is a simple Python program that implements the Caesar cipher encryption technique. It takes a string and a shift amount as input and performs encryption while preserving letter case.

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository to your computer.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the program by entering this command:

```bash
python generator.py
``` 

4. Follow the prompts to enter the text and shift amount for encryption.

## How it Works

The program prompts you for input text and the amount to shift the letters. It then applies the Caesar cipher algorithm, handling both lowercase and uppercase letters while preserving other characters.
